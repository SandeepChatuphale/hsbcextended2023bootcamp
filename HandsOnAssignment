Consider that Employee creation software needs to be developed for computerization of operations of an ABC organization.

1) Write an Employee class which contains following attributes:
Fields Data types 
id:int 
name:String 
basicSalary:double 
joiningDate:Date

2) Write showDetails() method which print employee information. Also write toString() method in Employee class. id MUST be generated automatically. Write TestEmployee as a client class.

3) Refer same Employee Application keep this Employee class inside appropriate package Write TestEmployee class and keep that in default package.

4) Now create a hierarchy: 
    WageEmployee and Manager these are Subclasses of Employee. SalesManager is subclass of Manager.

     Details of the classes as below:-

Class-Name                  Attributes 
-----------------------------------------------------
WageEmloyee                 hours ( int ) rate ( int )
Salary formula :- WageEmployee : - basicSalary + hours*rate 

Manager                     commision ( int ) 
SalesManager                 incentives ( int ) 
Manager: - basicSalary + commission; 
SalesManager: basicSalary + commission + incentives 
NOTE : - USE method overriding. (calculateSalary())

5) Upgrade the Employee creation system in such a way that - By using Utility class we should be able print the Employees (Employee, Manager, SalesManager, WageEmployee) details. Using Printable interface.

6) Upgrade the Employee creation system in such a way that now the system should be able to search an employee from a repository of employees based on the employeeId If user doesnâ€™t find then system should throw a customized exception EmployeeNotFoundException.
